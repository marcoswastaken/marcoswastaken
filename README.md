# Marcos Ortiz, PhD

I am a researcher with a PhD in Mathematics. For the past few years, I have been focused on applications of machine learning algorithms, and other data science tools, to solving real world problems.

Some highlights from my skill set:

- Proficient in Python, and SQL, including many common libraries
  - Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Polars, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.
- Deep understanding of the mathematics behind common deep learning algorithms, and experience implementing these tools to solve problems with real world data
- Experience building models using neural networks, including multiple variations of convolutional and recurrent neural networks (CNNs and RNNs)
  - Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Keras
- Experience working with natural language processing (NLP) tools, including embedding models, vector databases, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) pipelines
  - Hugging Face, LangChain, LanceDB
- Familiar with fundamental topics in statistics, including probability, hypothesis testing, and experimental design
- Capable of writing and presenting reports that communicate technical results to audiences with diverse backgrounds
